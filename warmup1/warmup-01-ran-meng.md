#### A famous quote by [Yoda](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Yoda):

> "For my ally is the Force. And a powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. It's energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter. You must feel the Force around you. Here, between you ... me...the tree...the rock...everywhere! Yes, even between this land and that ship."

3.Euclidean Distance
--------------------

### Definition <sub>\[<span style="color:blue">edit</span>\]</sub>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the <span style="color:blue">line segment</span> connecting them ( $\\mathbf{\\overline{pq}}$).

In <span style="color:blue">Cartesian coordinates</span>, if **p** = (*p<sub>1</sub>*, *p<sub>2</sub>*,..., *p<sub>n</sub>*) and **q** = (*q<sub>1</sub>*, *q<sub>2</sub>*,..., *q<sub>n</sub>*) are two points in <span style="color:blue">Euclidean n-space</span>, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by <span style="color:blue">Pythagorean formula</span>: <span style="color:blue"><sup>\[1\]</sup></span>

The position of a point in a Euclidean n-space is a <span style="color:blue">Euclidean vector</span>. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The <span style="color:blue">Euclidean norm</span>, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector: <span style="color:blue"><sup>\[1\]</sup></span>

$$ 
\\| \\mathbf{p} \\| = \\sqrt{p\_1^2+p\_2^2+\\cdot\\cdot\\cdot+p\_n^2} = \\sqrt{ \\mathbf{p}\\cdot\\mathbf{p}}, 
$$

where the last expression involves the <span style="color:blue">dot product</span>.
